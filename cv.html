                                I am still working on this course until the year 2021, But at the
                                moment all courses are going quite well, there are only a few courses that
                                I have a little more trouble with, Apart from that I think it is a nice course
                                to follow and the programming languages that they teach are really viable. In my spare time
                                I sometimes experiment with my own conceived projects, I
                                occasionally design websites and try to
                                imitate new things that appeal to me so that I gain more knowledge.
